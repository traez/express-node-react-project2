# Arpan Neupane - Express/Node + React Project

This is a solution to the [Arpan Neupane's Express/Node + React Project project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3vs4a03y3I). I'm testing my hand creating very simple projects for now to get familiar with the matter.

## Overview

### The Challenge/User Stories

Create a project with an Express/Node backend and a React frontend. We will set up a backend API with Express that returns an array of users and in the frontend, we will fetch that backend and display the same users onto the frontend.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (No)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library (No)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework (No)
- Tailwind CSS (No)
- Typescript (No)
- Nodejs
- Expressjs

### What I learned

- Node.js and Express.js backend with React frontend.
- My first time doing a React project with Vite as against CRA.
- I have to do NPM run on both server and client to get app to work. I still don't know my way around production ...getting it to work when deployed on Github-Vercel. With more learning this should be sorted out. Hated tutorial hell and wanted to get out by all means.

### Continued development

- More increasingly complex MERN stack projects.
