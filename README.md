# Arpan Neupane - Express/Node + React Project

This is a solution to the [Arpan Neupane's Express/Node + React Project project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3vs4a03y3I). I'm testing my hand creating very simple projects for now to get familiar with the matter.

## Overview

### The Challenge/User Stories

Create a project with an Express/Node backend and a React frontend. We will set up a backend API with Express that returns an array of users and in the frontend, we will fetch that backend and display the same users onto the frontend.
